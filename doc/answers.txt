Question 1:
    BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        nothing to commit, working tree clean

    AFTER CREATING A FILE AND A DIRECTORY:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            README.md
            doc/

        nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Question 2:
    alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        doc/

    The change now is that the new file (README.md) has been added to the changes to be committed,
    which are the ones that will be uploaded to the online repository after executing the `git push`
    command.

Question 3:
    The output of `git diff` is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git diff README.md
        diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
        index e69de29..f72c0a7 100644
        --- a/README.md
        +++ b/README.md

        +

        +Testing git.
        \ No newline at end of file

    The output of `git status` is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md

        Changes not staged for commit:
        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   README.md

        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            doc/

    As we can see, the current status is similar to the previous ones, but the changes to README.md have 
    to be added to the staging area. Furthermore, there's a difference between modified files and untracked
    files.
