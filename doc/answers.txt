Question 1:
    BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        nothing to commit, working tree clean

    AFTER CREATING A FILE AND A DIRECTORY:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            README.md
            doc/

        nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Question 2:
    alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

    Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        doc/

    The change now is that the new file (README.md) has been added to the changes to be committed,
    which are the ones that will be uploaded to the online repository after executing the `git push`
    command.

Question 3:
    The output of `git diff` is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git diff README.md
        diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
        index e69de29..f72c0a7 100644
        --- a/README.md
        +++ b/README.md
        @@ -0,0 +1,4 @@

        +
        +## Lab 0 status
        +Testing git.
        \ No newline at end of file

    The output of `git status` is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

        Changes to be committed:
        (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            new file:   README.md

        Changes not staged for commit:
        (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
        (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   README.md

        Untracked files:
        (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
            doc/

    As we can see, the current status is similar to the previous ones, but the changes to README.md have 
    to be added to the staging area. Furthermore, there's a difference between modified files and untracked
    files.

Question 4:
    A good message for the first commit could be something like: "First commit. README and answers.txt added."
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git commit -m "First commit. README and answers.txt added."
        [master bb8b25e] First commit. README and answers.txt added.
        2 files changed, 78 insertions(+)
        create mode 100644 README.md
        create mode 100644 doc/answers.txt

    After the `git commit` command, the `git status` output is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
        (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

        nothing to commit, working tree clean

Question 5:
    In the log there is just one commit, the one that we've done just before:
        commit bb8b25eb0f04f55754ce34efdc31229293d67c12 (HEAD -> master)
        Author: Alejandro-FA <61871580+Alejandro-FA@users.noreply.github.com>
        Date:   Wed Oct 6 17:20:34 2021 +0200

        First commit. README and answers.txt added.

    The first 7 digits that identify the commit are: bb8b25e

Question 6:
    The output is:
        alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git show HEAD
        commit 502a0173e7e410b650bb5ed8feaa7a52f762c762 (HEAD -> master)

        Date:   Wed Oct 6 17:29:16 2021 +0200

            Added 1 line to README.md

        diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
        index f72c0a7..057d653 100644

        +Testing git. Still testing git.
        \ No newline at end of file

    As we can see, the output shows all the changes realized in the last commit.

Question 7:
    alejandro@MacBook-Pro-de-Alejandro oop_labs % git reset HEAD README.md
    Unstaged changes after reset:
    M	README.md
    M	doc/answers.txt

    As we can see, the README.md is no longer in the staging area after executing the `git reset` command.
