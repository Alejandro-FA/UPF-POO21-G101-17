# Report Lab 4
Alejandro Fern√°ndez and Marc Aguilar

<br>

In order to properly organize all the code of this lab we have decided to **divide it in 4 distinct packages**: **`input`**, **`entities`**, **`gui`** and **`main`**, with an additional directory to store the data required (**`assets`**). Down below we explain in more detail the implementation of each of the packages.

## input

## entities

## gui

## main

## assets
