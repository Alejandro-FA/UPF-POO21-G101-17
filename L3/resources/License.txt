All Geographic data has been obtained from DataHub.io (https://datahub.io/collections/geojson),
which in turns uses the raw data of Natural Earh (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/).
Both sources allow the use of their data under these conditions:

You can also use our files under the previous conditions. If so, a mention to our work is welcome.

The division between continents has been performed accoriding to https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents.
For border-line or unspecified cases, we have tried to assign the region to the geographically closest continent.
